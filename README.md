# JavaScript Calculator

Through directly clicking on the calculator buttons, you can enter a string of operations that will follow the order of operations for the answer once the "=" button is pressed. There is a preview pane above the main number being entered that updates as you press the buttons. It allows you to see what was previously entered for the single calculation. After hitting enter, the answer will take up both the main display and the preview pane. If you wish to continue calculating based on that answer, you can follow it up by pressing the desired operator and continue as normal. However if you want to start a new calculation, you'l need to clear the calculator with the "C" button. Clearing removes the past history and returns the main display to 0, so it's ready for a new calculation. Please note that this app is meant for basic calculations as the display of the calculator wasn't made to accommodate massive numbers.
